# Ethical Considerations

## üîí Privacy and Data Protection

This project prioritizes the protection of individual privacy and responsible data usage. All data used in the database is sourced from publicly available information and complies with Maryland's public record access laws. I ensured that no personally identifiable information (PII) was stored or processed inappropriately.

I implemented careful design choices to:
- Avoid exposing sensitive personal data.
- Comply with data safety and privacy standards.
- Minimize ethical risks through anonymized, aggregated views.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Fair Use and Legal Compliance

To uphold fair use principles:
- I referenced and built upon publicly available datasets under educational fair use.
- I respected intellectual property laws and avoided infringement.
- I implemented clear documentation of data sources and usage boundaries.

## üß† Bias and Representation

A core ethical focus was to reduce biases in how data was modeled and queried:
- I assessed for unintentional data representation bias.
- Query design focused on neutral reporting (e.g., counts by type and location rather than demographic profiling).
- I adopted a transparent, equitable approach to schema design to reflect community-wide impact.

## üîÅ Continuous Ethical Review

Ethical handling of data isn't a one-time task. I developed:
- A framework for regular audits and feedback.
- A forward-looking plan to reassess ethics as more data is added or linked (e.g., with other counties).

By proactively applying ethical standards, our database offers not just analytical value‚Äîbut responsible, inclusive information access.
